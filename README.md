# Digital-Forensics
<b> I completed the Introduction to Digital Forensics certification by Security Blue Team. Used digital forensic techniques to locate hidden data on a workstation. Used steghide to extract embedded PII within image and music files. Discovered files with hidden extensions and used fcrackzip to brute force a zip folder and also used a dictionary attack supplied with the rockyou.txt wordlist in Kali Linux.

<b2>This was a hands-on certificate where I was required to completed a capstone project of a real-world like scenario. In this scenario I had to use digital forensic techniques to discover a security incident on a user's computer. I was able to uncover hidden company data such as usernames in one file, and passwords in another file. 

The usernames and passwords were secretly stored in one of the employee directories secretly using stenography. I was able to locate the digital evidence before the employee could successfully exfiltrate the data. 

This was achieved by locating hidden files and convert them to their correct extension for analysis, mapping out the file directory, extracting embedded files using steghide, cracking password protected zip files using fcrackzip in Kali Linux.
