# Digital-Forensics
<b> I completed the Introduction to Digital Forensics certification by Security Blue Team. Used digital forensic techniques to locate hidden data on a workstation. Used steghide to extract embedded PII within image and music files. Discovered files with hidden extensions and used fcrackzip to brute force a zip folder and also used a dictionary attack supplied with the rockyou.txt wordlist in Kali Linux.
