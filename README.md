# Digital-Forensics
<b>This was a hands-on certificate where I was required to completed a capstone project of a real-world like scenario. I used digital forensic techniques to locate hidden data on a workstation. I was able to uncover hidden company data such as usernames in one file, and passwords in another file. 
The usernames and passwords were secretly stored in one of the employee directories secretly using stenography. I was able to locate the digital evidence before the employee could successfully exfiltrate the data. 
This was achieved by locating hidden files and convert them to their correct extension for analysis, mapping out the file directory. I also used to Steghide to extract embedded PII within image and music files, and cracked password protected zip files using fcrackzip in Kali Linux. Although I used the brute force attack with fcrackzip, I also learned how to use a dictionary attack with this tool during the quizzes. The dictionary attack required that I provide the command with the wordlist rockyou.txt, located in the /wordlists directly in Kali linux.
